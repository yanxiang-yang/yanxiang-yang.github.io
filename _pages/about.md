I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of Sport and Health Management, at [Department of Physical Education](https://tiyuxi.sjtu.edu.cn) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), China. Prior to this, I studied in Munich, Philadelphia, Copenhagen, Cologne, and Shanghai.

I received my PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in Sport and Health Management at¬†[TUM School of Management](https://www.mgt.tum.de/)¬†of [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in 2023, with the highest distinction (_summa cum laude_). My PhD advisor was Professor¬†[J√∂rg K√∂nigstorfer](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/ordinarius/). During my time at TUM, I was also employed as Research Associate at¬†[Chair of Sport and Health Management](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/home/) of [TUM School of Medicine and Health](https://www.mh.tum.de/en/mh/homepage/), where I taught and supervised sport- and health-related courses and theses for both undergraduates and postgraduates.¬†In 2022, I stayed at [Department of Sport & Recreation Management](https://sthm.temple.edu/sport-and-recreation-management/) of Temple University in Philadelphia USA for 6 months, granted by a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Mobility fellowship. Here is my [alumniPage@TUM](https://www.hs.mh.tum.de/en/mgt/team/alumni/personal-information-yanxiang-yang/), where I crossed over the [spring](https://yanxiang-yang.github.io/images/path1.jpg), [summer](https://yanxiang-yang.github.io/images/path2.jpg), [autumn](https://yanxiang-yang.github.io/images/path3.jpg), and [winter](https://yanxiang-yang.github.io/images/path4.jpg) of Olympiapark to my office at Georg-Brauchle-Ring.

I earned my master's degree in Sport Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, advised by Professor [Shulin Cheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sulin-Cheng). During my master's, I spent 3 months at [German Sport University Cologne](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/), fully granted by [DAAD](https://www.daad.org.cn/zh/find-funding/funding-programmes-in-germany/master-short-term-scholarship).

Prior to that, I received my bachelor in Management at [School of Management](https://ms.shu.edu.cn) of [Shanghai University](https://shu.edu.cn/).
