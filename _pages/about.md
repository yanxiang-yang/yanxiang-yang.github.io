I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Chair of Sport and Health Management](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/home/) and [TUM School of Management](https://www.wi.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by Prof. Dr. [Jörg Königstorfer](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/ordinarius/).

I earned my B.M. in Management at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) in 2013 and M.Sc. in Sport Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, China. During my Masters' degree, I spent 3 months at [German Sport University Cologne](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/), granted by the [DAAD Short-term Scholarships for Master Students](https://www.daad.org.cn/zh/find-funding/funding-programmes-in-germany/master-short-term-scholarship). I also spent 6 months at the [Centre for Physical Activity Research](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/) of [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/), jointly granted by the [China Scholarship Council and Danish Government Scholarship](https://www.csc.edu.cn/chuguo).

I specialize in Sport and Physical Activity Management. In Sport Management, I focus on team sports; in physical activity, I focus on the use of gamified smartphone apps.
