I am currently a PhD candidate at [Chair of Sport and Health Management](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/home/) and [TUM School of Management](https://www.wi.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by Professor [Jörg Königstorfer](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/ordinarius/). Here is my [homepage@TUM](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/research-assistants/personal-information-yanxiang-yang/). I am also fortunate to be advised by Professors [Sebastian Uhrich](https://fis.dshs-koeln.de/portal/de/persons/sebastian-uhrich(d54fc935-c4f4-4231-8196-8896b3e4c01a).html), [Tim Pawlowski](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-sozialwissenschaften/sportwissenschaft/institut/arbeitsbereiche/sportoekonomik-sportmanagement-und-sportpublizistik/team/prof-dr-tim-pawlowski/), [Thilo Kunkel](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1782), and [Daniel Funk](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1771) on particular projects.

I earned my bachelor in Management at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) in 2013 and a master in Sport Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by Professor [Sulin Cheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sulin-Cheng). During my Masters' degree, I spent 3 months at [German Sport University Cologne](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/), granted by [DAAD](https://www.daad.org.cn/zh/find-funding/funding-programmes-in-germany/master-short-term-scholarship). I also spent 6 months at [Centre for Physical Activity Research](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/) of [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) with Dr. [Mathias Ried-Larsen](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/om/personer/item/mathias-ried-larsen), jointly granted by [CSC and Danish Government Scholarship](https://www.csc.edu.cn/chuguo). I like running and I am an amature tennis player.

## Research Interests
My general research interests focus on sport consumer behavior and physical activity, with particular focus on gamification and gamified (sport & fitness) smartphone apps. I am also interested in employing machine learning approach in team sports (e.g., football player transfer market, club performance) as well as tennis.
