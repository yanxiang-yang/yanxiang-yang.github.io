I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of Sport and Health Management, at [Department of Physical Education](https://tiyuxi.sjtu.edu.cn) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), China.

I received my PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in Sport and Health Management at [TUM School of Management](https://www.wi.tum.de/) of [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in 2023, with the highest distinction (Summa cum laude). My PhD advisor is Professor [Jörg Königstorfer](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/ordinarius/). During my time at TUM, I was employed as Research Associate at [Chair of Sport and Health Management](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/home/), where I taught and supervised sport- and health-related courses and theses for both undergraduates and postgraduates. In 2022, I stayed at the [Department of Sport Management](https://sthm.temple.edu/sport-and-recreation-management/) of Temple University in Philadelphia USA for 6 months, granted by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship (Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Funding of [EventRights](http://eventrights.net/)). I am also very fortunate to be advised by Professors [Sebastian Uhrich](https://fis.dshs-koeln.de/portal/de/persons/sebastian-uhrich(d54fc935-c4f4-4231-8196-8896b3e4c01a).html), [Tim Pawlowski](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-sozialwissenschaften/sportwissenschaft/institut/arbeitsbereiche/sportoekonomik-sportmanagement-und-sportpublizistik/team/prof-dr-tim-pawlowski/), [Thilo Kunkel](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1782), and [Daniel Funk](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1771) on particular projects. Here is my [homepage@TUM](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/research-assistants/personal-information-yanxiang-yang/).

I earned my master's degree in Sport Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by Professor [Shulin Cheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sulin-Cheng). During my master's, I spent 3 months at [German Sport University Cologne](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/) with Professors [Moritz Schumann](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/ab/prof/sportmedizin/professur/leitung.php.en) and [Wilhelm Bloch](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/visitenkarte/person/univ-prof-dr-wilhelm-bloch/), fully granted by [DAAD](https://www.daad.org.cn/zh/find-funding/funding-programmes-in-germany/master-short-term-scholarship). I also spent 6 months at [Centre for Physical Activity Research](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/) of [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) with Professors [Mathias Ried-Larsen](https://www.aktivsundhed.dk/riedlarsen-group) and [Bente Klarlund Pedersen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=iVihIzAAAAAJ&hl=da), fully granted by [CSC and Danish Government Scholarship](https://www.csc.edu.cn/chuguo). Prior to that, I received my bachelor in Management at [School of Management](https://ms.shu.edu.cn) of [Shanghai University](https://shu.edu.cn/).

I love sport, particularly evening run and tennis. I am a certified tennis referee.
