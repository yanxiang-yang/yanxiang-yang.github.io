## Research Summary
My general research interests focus on gamification and sport management. In particular, my first research stream - gamification - focuses on gamification (re-define in sport & health contexts) and gamified smartphone apps (acceptance & adoption, effectiveness) in consumers' physical activity and team sports experience. My second research stream - sport management - focuses on deploying advanced machine learning approach to investigate team sport clubs' activities (transfer market, performance).
